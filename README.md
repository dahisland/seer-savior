# SEER SAVIOR

This project under deployment is a little casual web gaming project implemented in mobile first.
Rules of the game are quick simple but involves to work on an algorithm.
I also want to implement an API to offer user the possibility to create an account, register his score, have access to the
better global scores and win some skins for his profile avatar when he win a level.

I work on this project to perform my front end skills on React development and deepen my learning by exploring some backend skills.
