# SEER SAVIOR

This project under deployment is a little casual web gaming project implemented in mobile first.
Rules of the game are quick simple but involves to work on an algorithm.
I also want to implement an API to offer user th possibility to create an account, register his score, have acces to the
better global scores and win some skins for his profile avatar when he win a level.

I work on this project to perform my front end skills on React devlopment and deepen my learning by exploring some backend skills.
